# THEVOID

This is an ecommerce web application that I made as a React.js + Vite.js practice

It is the first web application I have made with React, when I finish it, which won't be long, I will do more to continue practicing

Some details of my ecommerce:

- Email.js (Functional Form + Auto-Reply ✅)
- Fast Navegation ✅
- Interactive, fluid and attractive interface. ✅
- Product filtering ✅
- Product details ✅
- Functional shopping cart ✅

For this project I added a database like Firestore, to be able to save the information of each product along with the stock and transport that information to my web application

## Complications

Also, it's not bad to clarify what it cost me to do since it was something new for me. At the beginning I had put my products in an asynmock.js within Visual which caused me complications later when trying to replace the code so that it took the data from my Firestore and not from the js, finally I was able to achieve it with some help and now For the other projects I do, it will become easier and easier for me.
